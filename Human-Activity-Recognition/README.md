# Human Activity Recognition 
In this project, sensor data from wearable devices is used to classify human activities such as walking, sitting, or standing. The dataset is segmented using a sliding window approach and then analyzed through two classification models: **Gradient Bossting and Random Forest**. Emphasis is placed on preprocessing sequential time-series data and evaluating the models using standard classification metrics.
