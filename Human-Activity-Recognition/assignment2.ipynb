    "For the first task, two modeles were created, trained and tested with the dataset given. The first model created was a Gradient booster model, and the second was a Random forest model. Both models showed a good performance in terms of accuracy but the model I choose to continue with was the Random forest model beacuse of its slightly higher accuracy compared to the Gradient booster model. The models also had different values between the precision and recall of the classes, where the Random forest model had higher precision and recall precantage for the classes 3, 4, and 5 eventhough the frequency of those classes were low. \n",

    "To visualize the data, a heat map (plots folder) was used to identify the correlation between the features and the labels. The features back_y and thigh_y showed low correlation, meaning that an increase and decrese of those features had small effects on the class predicition. Initally, feature selection started by removing those features, and a backward elimation was used. Multiple Random forest models with different amount of features were trained, and the accuracy of the models decreased as the number of features decreased. However, two models were trained with only two features, and thoes models showed high accuracy but lower than the models with four and three of the features. This indicates that the minimal set of features needed for prediction is 2 but should be picked with thigh_x and either back_x or back_z. \n",
