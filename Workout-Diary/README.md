# Workout Diary
Workout Diary is a digital fitness diary that allows users to design custom workouts while helping them track their progress over time. The app fetches exercise data from the **NinjaAPI**, giving users access to a wide range of exercises across different muscle groups. Users can select exercises and define the number of sets and repitions for each exercise. The development of the application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which promotes a clear seperation by isolating the user interface, logic, and data management components. 

Currently, the application lacks several desired features that would significantly enchance its useability. Feature implementations could include connecting to a database for presistant workout data storage, integrating compatibility with wearable sensors, refining the user interface, using machine learning alghritms to personlize workout recommendations, and introduce a goal-setting system to support user motivation.
