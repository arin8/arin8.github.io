# Plotting Actions - Expected Threat Analysis of Aitana Bonmatí 

This project analyzes the expected threat (xT) generated by ball carries and passes from the Spanish women's national football player **Aitana Bonmatí** during the **Women's Euro 2023**. Her outputs are compared to three other players in the tournament with similar midfield roles. The aim is to understand how Bonmatí contributes to her team's attacking progression relative to her peers, using event data and spatial threat modeling.
