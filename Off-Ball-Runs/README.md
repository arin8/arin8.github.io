# Off Ball Runs
In this project, Inter player Nicoló Barella's runs in defensive and offensive possessions in the 2023 UEFA Champios League final were analysed using vector representation and directional statistics. Focus was also placed on identifying attacking runs that increased expected goals (xG). The analysis revealed key movement patterns and tactical tendencies that characterized Barella's role throughout the match.
