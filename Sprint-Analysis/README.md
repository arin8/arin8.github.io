# Sprint Analysis 
For this project, the aerobic and anaerobic capaicty of **Inter's** players during the **UEFA Champions League final 2023** is assesed using tracking data. The analysis support theoretical insights into how the body respons to sprint bursts and prolonged running within in a context of a football match. Observations are also made on how certain factors affect the outcome of a game, according to the Integrated View of Factors framework, by specifically examining total distance covered following substitutions or after conceding goals. 

The analysis reveals that total distance covered significantly decreases following a high-intensity sprint exceeding 24 km/h and the total distance covered was highest at the beginning of the match, drops before halftime, slightly increase after halftime, and reaches its lowest point towards the end of the game. These patterns relate to glycogen deleption and potassium accumulation. Substitutions slighlty increase total distance covered, and Inter brings on four defenders after conceding a goal. This suggests that fresh legs can enchance a team's physical capacity but to bring on four defenders is uncomman and likely reflects Inter's style of play.
