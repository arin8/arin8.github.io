# Sprint Analysis 
For this project, the aerobic and anaerobic capaicty of Inter's players during the UEFA Champions League final 2023 was assesed using tracking data. The analysis supported theoretical insights into how the body respons to sprint bursts and prolonged running within in a context of a football match. Obersvations were also made on how certain factors can effect the outcome of a game, accordring to the Integrated View of Factors framework, by specifically looking at total distance covered following substitutions or after conceding goals. 

The outcome of the analysis reavled that total distance covered significantly decreases following a high-intensity sprint exceeding 24 km/h and the total distance covered was highest at the beginning of the match, showed a slight increase after halftime, and reached its lowest point towards the end of the game. This has to do with glycogen deleption and potassium accumulation.
